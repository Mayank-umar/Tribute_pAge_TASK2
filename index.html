                <p class="about">Veer Savarkar’s (1863 – 1902) inayak Damodar Savarkar (pronunciation (help·info)),
                    Marathi pronunciation: [ʋinaːjək saːʋəɾkəɾ]; 28 May 1883 – 26 February 1966) was an Indian
                    politician, activist, and writer. Savarkar developed the Hindu nationalist political ideology of
                    Hindutva while imprisoned at Ratnagiri in 1922.[3][4] He was a leading figure in the Hindu
                    Mahasabha.[5] He started using the honorific prefix Veer ("brave") since he wrote his
                    autobiography.[6] Savarkar joined the Hindu Mahasabha and popularized the term Hindutva
                    (Hinduness),[7] previously coined by Chandranath Basu,[8] to create a collective "Hindu" identity as
                    an essence of Bharat (India).[9][10] Savarkar was an atheist.[11]

                    Savarkar began his political activities as a high school student and continued to do so at Fergusson
                    College in Pune.[12] He and his brother founded a secret society called Abhinav Bharat Society. When
                    he went to the United Kingdom for his law studies, he involved himself with organizations such as
                    India House and the Free India Society. He also published books advocating complete Indian
                    independence by revolutionary means.[13] One of the books he published called The Indian War of
                    Independence about the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was banned by the British colonial authorities.[14]

                    In 1910, Savarkar was arrested and ordered to be extradited to India for his connections with the
                    revolutionary group India House. On the voyage back to India, Savarkar staged an attempt to escape
                    jumping from steamship SS Morea and seek asylum in France while the ship was docked in the port of
                    Marseilles. The French port officials however handed him back to the British government. On return
                    to India, Savarkar was sentenced to life terms of imprisonment totaling fifty years and was moved to
                    the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He was released in 1924 by the British
                    officials after he wrote a series of mercy petitions to the British.[15] He virtually stopped any
                    criticism of the British regime after he was released from jail.[16]

                    After 1937, he started traveling widely, becoming a forceful orator and writer, advocating Hindu
                    political and social unity. In 1938, he was a president of Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in Mumbai.
                    Serving as the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar endorsed the idea of India as a Hindu
                    Rashtra (Hindu Nation). Savarkar assured the Sikhs that "when the Muslims woke from their day-dreams
                    of Pakistan, they would see established instead a Sikhistan in the Punjab." Savarkar not only talked
                    of Hindudom, Hindu Nation and Hindu Raj, but he wanted to depend upon the Sikhs in the Punjab to
                    establish a Sikhistan.[17][18][19]

                    By 1939, Savarkar committed an alliance with the Muslim League after both were decimated by the
                    Indian National Congress. He also supported the two-nation theory. He opposed the call for the Quit
                    India Movement and boycotted it officially.[20] He even went to the extent of writing a letter
                    titled "Stick to your Posts" and recruited for the British in World War 2.[21] In 1948, Savarkar was
                    charged as a co-conspirator in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi; however, he was acquitted by the
                    court for lack of evidence.
